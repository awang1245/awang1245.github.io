              White tea is the most delicate style of Camellia sinensis,
              processed with as little handling as possible to keep its natural
              sweetness. It originated in Fujian, China, made from early spring
              buds and young leaves covered in soft silver hairs. Known for its
              light flavor and gentle energy, white tea brews into a soft,
              smooth cup.
            </p>
            <p class="desc">
              The leaves are picked and slowly withered for 1-2 days, allowing
              slight natural oxidation that builds sweetness without bitterness.
              Expect subtle notes of honey, fresh hay, mild fruit, and melon.
              Common types include Silver Needle (bud-only, very light) and
              White Peony (bud and leaves, slightly fuller).
