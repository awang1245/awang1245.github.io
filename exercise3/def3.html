          (2012), Anil Dash writes: "In the early days of the social web, there
          was a broad expectation that regular people might own their own
          identities by having their own websites, instead of being dependent on
          a few big sites to host their online identity."

          In February 2015 the online journal QUARTZ published an article with
          the provocative headline:
          <a
            href="https://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet"
            >Millions of Facebook users have no idea they&rsquo;re using the
            internet</a
          >. As the article states: "This is more than a matter of semantics.
          The expectations and behaviors of the next billion people to come
          online will have profound effects on how the internet evolves."

          In October 2014 the online journal GIZMODO published an article
          heralding
          <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-great-web-1-0-revival-1651487835"
            >The Great Web 1.0 Revival</a
          >. Its author Kyle Chayka observed: <br />The booming size of today's
          mainstream social networks and the constant level of noise we have to
          deal with has inspired a sudden return to a time when the internet was
          quieter, safer, and more intimate... We're nostalgic for the
          close-knit, DIY nature of the early web, where everything was
          smaller...<br />
          The DIY aesthetics and practices of the mid-1990s have been embraced
          by the anti-social network
          <a href="https://tilde.club/">TILDE.CLUB</a>, which hosts a small
          community of users on a single unix computer. For some, TILDE.CLUB
          serves as a platform for revisiting amateur web aesthetics in a
          contemporary context. For example, on her page, Olia Lialina invites
          users to view a new net art work
          <a href="https://tilde.club/~olialia/">640x480</a> - a 4-tab browser
          installation. For many others however, TILDE.CLUB has served as little
          more than a hip territory to occupy. Many pages remain blank.

          In other corners of the internet, Web 1.0 aesthetics have never
          disappeared. <a href="https://luckysoap.com/">My own website</a>,
          including this page, which uses fixed-width table cells, is based on a
          template I created in HomeSite in 1997.
        </p>
        <p>
          Web 1.0 aesthetics persist in source code and stated objectives of the
          massive <a href="https://www.ubuweb.com/">Ubu Web</a> site, an
          "independent resource dedicated to all strains of the avant-garde,
          ethnopoetics, and outsider arts." On 16 December 2014, the founder of
          <a href="https://x.com/ubuweb/status/545074372093165568"></a>boasted
          on Twitter that "the whole damn site is still hand-coded in html 1.0
          in bbedit, from templates made in 1996."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shall put off updating my website templates until out-of-date design
          is no longer cool.
