          <p class="handmade">
            The term 'handmade' usually refers to objects made by hand or by
            using simple tools rather than machines.
          </p>
          <p class="result-start">
            The result may be homely — as in a child's clay ashtray
          </p>
          <p class="result-end">
            — or exquisite — as in a pair of bespoke brogues.

          <h2>DEF 01</h2>
          <p>
            I evoke the term 'handmade web' to refer to web pages coded by hand
            rather than by software; web pages made and maintained by
            individuals rather than by businesses or corporations; web pages
            which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages which
            challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership,
            privacy, security, or identity.
          </p>

          <h2>DEF 02</h2>
          <p>
            I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to make a correlation
            between handmade web pages and handmade print materials, such as
            zines, pamphlets, and artists books.
          </p>
        </a>
        <a href="./def2.html" class="def-link">
          <h2>DEF 03</h2>
          <p>
            I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to advocate for an ongoing
            active engagement with the making of web pages and of web policies.
          </p>
        </a>
        <a href="./def2.html" class="def-link">
          <h2>DEF 04</h2>
          <p>
            I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to draw attention both to
            the manual labour involved in the composition of web pages, and the
            functioning of the web page itself as a 'manual', a 'handbook', a
            set of instructions required for a computer program to run.
          </p>
        </a>
        <a href="./def2.html" class="def-link">
          <h2>DEF 05</h2>
          <p>
            I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to draw attention to the
            physical body.
          </p>
        </a>
        <a href="./def2.html" class="def-link">
          <h2>DEF 06</h2>
          <p>
            I evoke the term 'handmade web' to suggest slowness and smallness as
            a forms of resistance.
