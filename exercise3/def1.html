    <h1><a href="./index.html">A Handmade Web</a>: Definition 01</h1>
    <p>
      <b>
        I evoke the term 'handmade web' to refer to web pages coded by hand
        rather than by software; web pages made and maintained by individuals
        rather than by businesses or corporations; web pages which are
        provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages which challenge
        conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security,
        or identity.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Handmade web pages flourished in the mid-to-late-1990s, in the brief
      period after the academic web and before the corporate web.
      &lsquo;Handmade&rsquo; is by no means the only or best term to define the
      web of this period.

      In her essay,
      <a href="https://art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/"
        >A Vernacular Web</a
      >
      (2005), Olia Lialina describes the web of the mid-1990s as: bright, rich,
      personal, slow and under construction. It was a web of sudden connections
      and personal links. Pages were built on the edge of tomorrow, full of hope
      for a faster connection and a more powerful computer... it was a web of
      amateurs soon to be washed away by dot.com ambitions, professional
      authoring tools and guidelines designed by usability experts.<br />For
      more information on Olia Lialina and Dragan Espenschied's excellent
      research on the amateur web, see:
